  We developed a QA web app for our major project.
  The ChatNepali(Open-Source Nepali Health-QA Language Model with Finetuned Transformers and External Knowledge Bases) aims to provide accessible and accurate health-related information in the Nepali language. By fine-tuning the mT5 transformer model and leveraging a vector database, this project enhances the capability of answering health-related queries with precision and contextual relevance. The system offers valuable second opinions and supports users in making informed health decisions.
